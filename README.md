12)*Measles Epidemic*

A *measles epidemic* refers to a widespread outbreak of *measles, a highly contagious viral disease that primarily affects young children. Measles is characterized by fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat, inflamed eyes (conjunctivitis), and a distinctive red, blotchy skin rash that usually starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. The disease is caused by the **measles virus*, which spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

### Causes and Transmission:
Measles is caused by the *measles virus, which is a member of the paramyxovirus family. The virus is spread by **airborne droplets* through coughing, sneezing, or even talking, making it one of the most contagious viruses known. An infected person can spread the virus to others even before the symptoms appear, often when they are feeling only mild or no symptoms. The virus remains active in the air or on surfaces for up to two hours, contributing to its rapid spread, especially in areas with close living conditions such as schools, hospitals, and daycare centers.

### Symptoms:
The initial symptoms of measles typically appear 10 to 12 days after exposure to the virus and include:
- *High fever*
- *Cough*
- *Runny nose (rhinorrhea)*
- *Sore throat*
- *Red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis)*
- *White spots in the mouth (Koplik spots)*
- A *rash* that starts on the face and spreads downward to the rest of the body, typically 3 to 5 days after the initial symptoms begin.

### Complications:
While measles is often considered a childhood illness, it can lead to serious complications, especially in young children, adults over the age of 20, and those with weakened immune systems. Complications include:
1. *Pneumonia*: The most common cause of death from measles.

5. *Blindness*: In cases of severe vitamin A deficiency or complications from the infection.

### Measles Epidemics:
Measles epidemics occur when vaccination coverage rates fall below the threshold needed to maintain *herd immunity* (usually around 95%). When large groups of individuals are unvaccinated or under-vaccinated, the virus can spread rapidly, leading to outbreaks. Factors contributing to measles epidemics include:
- *Vaccine hesitancy*: Some people refuse or delay vaccination due to misconceptions or fears about vaccine safety.
- *Poor healthcare access*: In low-resource settings, lack of access to healthcare services and vaccines can lead to outbreaks.
- *Increased international travel*: Measles outbreaks in one country can be spread to others through travelers, leading to international epidemics.
- *Breakthrough infections*: Although rare, individuals who have been vaccinated can still get infected if exposed to a large enough viral dose.

### Prevention and Control:
*Vaccination* is the most effective method of preventing measles. The *measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine* is typically given in two dosesâ€”one at 12 to 15 months of age and a second at 4 to 6 years of age. This vaccine is highly effective at preventing measles and can provide lifelong immunity.

To control and prevent an epidemic, public health measures include:
1. *Vaccination campaigns*: In areas experiencing an outbreak, health authorities may launch mass vaccination campaigns to rapidly increase vaccination coverage.
2. *Isolation of infected individuals*: To prevent further spread, infected individuals should be kept away from others, particularly in high-risk settings like schools and hospitals, until they are no longer contagious (usually 4 days after the rash appears).
3. *Surveillance and monitoring*: Monitoring measles cases allows for rapid identification and containment of outbreaks. Contact tracing and identifying unvaccinated individuals can help limit the spread.
4. *Public education*: Educating the public about the importance of vaccination and the risks of measles can help prevent the spread of misinformation and vaccine hesitancy.
5. *Vitamin A supplementation*: In regions with high rates of vitamin A deficiency, providing vitamin A to children can help reduce the severity of the disease and prevent complications like blindness.

### Global Efforts:
Measles was once a leading cause of death among children worldwide. However, since the introduction of the measles vaccine, global cases have decreased significantly. According to the *World Health Organization (WHO)*, there has been a 73% reduction in global measles deaths between 2000 and 2018. Despite this progress, measles remains a significant public health concern, particularly in areas with low vaccination coverage or in conflict zones where healthcare services are disrupted.

### Conclusion:
Measles epidemics can be devastating, but they are largely preventable through vaccination. Public health efforts focused on increasing vaccination rates, monitoring outbreaks, and addressing vaccine hesitancy are essential to preventing and controlling measles. Continuing to invest in global vaccination programs and education is key to achieving the goal of eliminating measles and protecting communities from future outbreaks.

15) *emergency contraceptives*. Emergency contraceptives (EC) are methods of birth control used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex or contraceptive failure, such as condom breakage or missed birth control pills. They are not intended for regular contraception but are a backup option when other contraceptive methods fail or were not used.

### *Types of Emergency Contraceptives:*

1. *Emergency Contraceptive Pills (ECPs)*:
   These pills are the most commonly used form of emergency contraception. There are different types of pills, with the two most common being:
   - *Levonorgestrel (Plan B One-Step)*: A progestin-only pill that is most effective when taken within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse. However, it can work up to 5 days after.
   - *Ulipristal acetate (ella)*: A prescription-only pill that can be effective up to 5 days after unprotected sex. It works by delaying or inhibiting ovulation.

   *Mechanism*: Emergency contraceptive pills work by:
   - Preventing or delaying ovulation (the release of an egg).
   - Altering the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the egg.
   - In some cases, preventing a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus.

2. *Copper Intrauterine Device (IUD)*:
   The copper IUD can also be used as emergency contraception when inserted by a healthcare provider within *5 days* of unprotected sex. The copper in the IUD creates a hostile environment for sperm and eggs, preventing fertilization and implantation.

   *Effectiveness*: The copper IUD is the most effective form of emergency contraception, with a failure rate of less than 1% if inserted within the recommended time frame.

3. *Emergency Contraceptive Injection*:
   In some cases, injectable forms of emergency contraception may be available, though they are less common and require a healthcare provider's involvement.

### *Effectiveness of Emergency Contraception*:
The effectiveness of emergency contraception depends on the method used and how quickly it is taken after unprotected sex. The sooner emergency contraception is used, the more effective it will be:
- *Levonorgestrel pills*: 75-89% effective if taken within 72 hours, and less effective as time passes.
- *Ulipristal acetate*: About 85% effective when taken within 5 days of unprotected sex.
- *Copper IUD*: Over 99% effective, making it the most reliable option.

### *Important Points to Remember*:
- Emergency contraception does not protect against *sexually transmitted infections (STIs)*.
- It is not an abortion method and will not be effective if the woman is already pregnant.
- Emergency contraception is intended for *occasional use* and should not replace regular contraceptive methods like birth control pills or condoms.
- Emergency contraceptives are available over-the-counter in many countries, though ulipristal acetate and the IUD may require a prescription.

### *Side Effects*:
Common side effects of emergency contraceptive pills may include:
- Nausea or vomiting (which may require a second dose if vomiting occurs within 2 hours of taking the pill).
- Irregular bleeding or spotting.
- Fatigue, headache, dizziness, or breast tenderness.
   
It is important to note that emergency contraception does not provide ongoing contraception protection, and you should discuss long-term birth control options with a healthcare provider if needed.

### *Conclusion*:
Emergency contraception is an essential tool in reproductive health, allowing individuals to prevent pregnancy after contraceptive failure or unprotected sex. While highly effective when used correctly, it is important to remember that emergency contraception should not be relied upon as a regular method of birth control. Regular contraception methods such as condoms, birth control pills, or IUDs are more effective at preventing pregnancy when used consistently.
